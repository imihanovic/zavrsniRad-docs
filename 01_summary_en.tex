\subsection*{Developing web application for primary healthcare data management}
The aim of this final paper is to develop a web application for managing data in primary healthcare. The application \textit{PrimeCareMed} is built using Razor Pages, which are part of the ASP.NET Core framework. The application is intended for users who can have one of four different roles, determining the functionalities available to each user. The most crucial features of the application include the system login and the addition of new patient records. Editing patient records is achieved through inputting reports, vaccinations, and prescriptions for each appointment. This written paper will describe the approach used to implement the application and present the technologies that were utilized.
